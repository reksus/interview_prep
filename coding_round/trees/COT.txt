OBSERVATIONS:
- tree can constructed with : 
    inorder + (pre | post | level)
can't be constructed if inorder is not there

- lca
    subproblem is to check is to check the EXISTENCE of either node is left or right subtree

what to return from the subproblem
- diameter : height of node
- lca: existence of node
- max_path_sum: max sum incl the node



TACTICS:
- height of null node is -1
    when backtracting and +1 it would become 0
